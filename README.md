# Gelug

An alternative to Noisli made in [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4201/` or wait until the compiler opens a window. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. If you wish to run the project inside a subfolder, run the command `npm run subfolder-build` to build it to run under the `\gelug\` subfolder in your server.
